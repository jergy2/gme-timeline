                        target="_blank">DTC</a>, is the registered owner of the majority of all issued shares of
                    publicly traded companies in the United
                    States

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            As of 1998, Cede & Co. was the registered owner of 83% of all issued shares in the United
                            States
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Since 1998, this
                            ownership percentage has not been publicly released again
                        </li>
                        <li>When shares of a company are purchased at a stock broker, the buyer becomes a beneficial
                            owner of shares but holds only share entitlements. The registered holder of those
                            shares is Cede & Co.</li>
                        <li>Due to lack of transparency by Cede & Co. and the DTC, the number of share entitlements that
                            exist
                            among stock brokers and other market participants cannot be verified</li>

                <li>DRS is an acronym for Direct Registration System

                    <ul>
                        <li>DRS is a mechanism that enables investors to own and hold shares registered in their own name on the issuing company's shareholder register, making the shareholder known to the company</li>
                        <li>Moving shares to DRS removes Cede & Co's registered ownership of those shares, making the investor the registered owner</li>

            <div class="section-heading">How to hold shares of GME in DRS form</div>
            <p>Owning directly registered shares of GME can be achieved mainly in 2 different ways. Each method is a
                2-step process.</p>

            <b>Method 1:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>An investor purchases shares of GME at a stock broker, for example Fidelity
                </li>
                <li>The investor requests to the broker to transfer the shares to DRS</li>
            </ol>
            <p></p>

            <b>Method 2:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>An investor purchases shares of GME from GameStop's transfer agent Computershare
                </li>
                <li>The investor requests to Computershare to transfer their shares from Computershare's plan into DRS

            <div class="section-heading">Held by registered holders with Computershare: DRS versus DSPP</div>
            <p>All shares held with GameStop's transfer agent Computershare are considered "registered",
                which means that the individual investor is listed by name on the issuer's (GameStop's) stock ledger
                (also referred to as
                the "register") and the investor is therefore known to the company.

            <p>
                GameStop reports this information in their 10-Q / 10-K filings.<br>

                However, of registered shares, there is an important distinction between shares held in DRS form versus
