options/calls buyer
They're back buying another 5000 June 21st $20 calls... 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d2nvh3/theyre_back_buying_another_5000_june_21st_20_calls/

"100M in option premiums so far "



"The open interest at that strike is over 120k contracts now, which is equivalent to 12 million shares. 
If they are buying them at let’s say an average contract price of 5.00 (no idea how accurate this is) the break even price for these to make money is $25. 
Someone is confident enough that these are a solid investment that they are still buying 5000 lots of these at $8 a contract. 
Meaning they probably see the price above 30 by June 21st. 
Also with that amount of contracts being bought and potentially exercised those shares will need to be delivered and hedged leading to price impact. 
It also seems pretty impossible to offload these contracts with how many they have and make money so this seems like someone who wants that many shares at <$30

I have not seen this large of open interest in GME at any strike before"


"prevailing theory is that it's UBS attempting to unwind their position they inherited from credit suisse. 
they are buying these calls with intent to exercise at a controlled dollar amount. 
we expect they will call these shares and then the call contract writers here will have to go to the lit market to procure the called shares. 
hopefully the first of many bloodbaths. "

CNBC getting owned by DFV

"They fucking hate how unserious and informal all this situation is. Look at them so well groomed with their suits 
and fancy clothes, and then look at RK looking like a half dead hippie, but betting on GME with a massive fortune 
than they can only dream about lmao. "

"So hilarious how casual and unaffected he was by the massive swing in share price… he’s so fucking confident in 
his investment he doesn’t even flinch at hundred’s of millions of dollars in paper losses in a day. 
That was definitely NOT what MSM was expecting to happen on the livestream. I hope he keeps trolling them, 
lulling them into a false sense of security and then exercising them when they’re not expecting and catching them flat footed. "

Andrew Left, Citron, investigated by DOJ
https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ecpfkm/the_lead_got_buried_your_fcked_andrew_sec_suing/


"
In Feb 2021, DOJ announced they were investigated possible criminality around GameStop trading.

The DOJ kicked Left’s door a month later, in March 2021 and confiscated his electronics.

In May 2021, the SEC approached GameStop asking for documents regarding a probe into its stock trading. GameStop acknowledges they do not expect to face any repercussions from willingly providing these requested documents.

In Dec 2021, DOJ announces a comprehensive, major investigation into short sellers of stocks in the US markets.

The trees were planted and pissed on many moons ago, and they are beginning to bear fruit.
