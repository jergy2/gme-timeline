regarding Vlad Tenev AMA

mod comment:
We are seeing a ton of reposts of this particular AMA. The company behind this AMA is paying Reddit to promote this AMA to Superstonk in the form of ads. The mod team has sincere and well-founded concerns that discussion/coordination about participating in this AMA (which will not be hosted on Superstonk in any way, shape or form) could be considered brigading by Reddit Admins. As a result, we are having to remove all reposted posts referencing this AMA. We are also removing any comment indicating that people are going to participate or ask a specific question.
These removals come with a strong warning that discussions about other subs, coordination about participating in discussions on other subs, or harassing Reddit users in their AMA will be met with zero tolerance. We have to adopt this position to keep our sub safe and in compliance with Reddit rules.
Please, please, just don't bring this AMA content to Superstonk. We don't need it here.
I'm locking comments on this post because we're seeing an uptick in "I'm going to ask him... " and that's *exactly* what could get this sub in trouble. Please, don't engage with this content, and just focus on GME.

CONSEQUENCES

https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/16ufib6/scc_update_post_9282023/


No other tickers. No brigading.

- The SCC has been able to see firsthand that the core mission of Superstonk - promotion and discussion of GME and GME-adjacent-macroeconomic content - is under constant challenge by people who are pushing other tickers and brigading from other subs. Sometimes these are crypto scams. Sometimes these are other "meme" stocks that are believed to be part of the basket. We are unapologetically strict GME supporters. That doesn't mean you have to be. But, if you want to invoke another stock in any way on this sub -- make sure you tie the case clearly back to GME and make sure the overwhelming majority of your content is GME-related. We will continue to take a hard-line stance that you are allowed to support any stock you want... but you can only discuss GME here. Content promoting another ticker or encouraging people from this sub to venture to another sub will be removed.

- It's the unfortunate reality that Reddit holds us to a higher standard against brigading than other subs. While you might have noticed evidence that other subs come here to be disruptive, they will face eventual consequences from Reddit -- our job is to keep Superstonk safe... and what that looks like is removing comments and posts directing Superstonkers to other subs. This is unfortunate, but it is our reality and it is beyond our control.
